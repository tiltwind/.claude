# Agent Orchestration

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth.ts
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utils.ts

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
